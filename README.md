#  Algorithm exercises

**Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers**


1.start
2.input two numbers n1,n2
3.sum of two numbers
4.display sum
5.end


**Problem 2: Check for Prime Number**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.

1.start
2.read the number n
3.start the loop from i=2 to i=n-1
4.if n is divisible by "i" in the loop then break the loop
5.if(i==n) that means loop has executed till the end of range so n is not divisible by any nymber so it is a prime number.
6.else its not a prime number 
7.end
**Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**

1.srat
2.input three numbers a,b,c
3.compare a and b to find the larger of the two
4.compare the result with c to find the largest number
5.display the maximum value
6.end


**Problem 4: Factorial Calculation**

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

1.start
2.input a number n
3.intialize a variable factorial to 1
4.use a loop to multiply all integers from 1 to n
  factorial=factorial*1
5.display the value of factorial
6.end


**Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

1.start
2.input a number n
3.check if n is divisible by 2
  if yes,display "even"
  if no,display "odd"
4.stop
